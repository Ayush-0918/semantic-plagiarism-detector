# Orchestrators (Docker Compose, Kubernetes) use this to know when the
# Streamlit app is actually ready to serve traffic.
#
# Note: the app also runs a background FastAPI server (src/api/app.py) on
# port 8000 which exposes /healthz, but that port isn't published by this
# image and the container's primary listener is Streamlit on 8501. We
# target Streamlit's own built-in /_stcore/health endpoint instead — the
# same endpoint already relied on by the "app" service healthcheck in
# docker-compose.yml — so both healthcheck definitions stay consistent
# and actually reachable.
